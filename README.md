## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Animal and Cart:** The player does not directly control the animal or the cart. Instead, they manipulate the environment by adjusting the sliders to ensure the animal can pass through unobstructed.
- **Sliders:** The sliders are movable elements that players can control. They are positioned vertically on the screen and can be adjusted up or down to create gaps for the animal to pass through.
- **Game Spee:** The speed of the cart and the obstacles gradually increases as the game progresses, adding to the challenge and requiring players to react faster.
- **Score and Progression:** Players earn points based on the distance traveled and obstacles passed. As they progress further, they unlock new levels, challenges, and customization options for the animal and cart.
- **Failure to Pass Through Sliders:** If the player fails to adjust the sliders in time to create a gap for the animal to pass through, they have a brief window before the approaching obstacle wave catches up. If the gap isn't created in time, the animal collides with the obstacle, the cart is destroyed, and the player loses the game.
